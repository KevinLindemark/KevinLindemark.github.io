        <p>The Commodore 64, also known as the C64 or the CBM 64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982
            by Commodore International (first shown at the Consumer Electronics Show, January 7â€“10, 1982, in Las
            Vegas).[4] It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of
            all time,[5] with independent estimates placing the number sold between 12.5 and 17 million units.[2] Volume
            production started in early 1982, marketing in August for US$595 (equivalent to $1,596 in 2020).[6][7]
            Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536
            bytes) of RAM. With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could
            create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware. </p>
