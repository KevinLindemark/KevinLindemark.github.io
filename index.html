            ENIAC (/ˈɛniæk/; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)[1][2] was the first programmable, electronic,
            general-purpose digital computer made in 1945.[3][4] It was Turing-complete and able to solve "a large class
            of numerical problems" through reprogramming.[5][6]

            Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States
            Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory (which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory),[7][8] its
            first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.[9][10]

            ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for practical purposes on December 10, 1945.[11]

            ENIAC was formally dedicated at the University of Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946, having cost $487,000
            (equivalent to $5,900,000 in 2019), and was heralded as a "Giant Brain" by the press.[12] It had a speed on
            the order of one thousand times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines; this computational power,
            coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists alike. The combination
            of speed and programmability allowed for thousands more calculations for problems, as ENIAC calculated a
            trajectory in 30 seconds that took a human 20 hours (allowing one ENIAC to displace 2,400 humans).[13] </p>
