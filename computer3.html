        <p>The Macintosh (mainly Mac since 1998)[1] is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured,
            and sold by Apple Inc. (originally as Apple Computer, Inc.) since January 1984.
            The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market all-in-one desktop personal computer to have
            featured
            a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse.[2] Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular
            Apple
            II, Apple IIGS, Apple III, and Apple Lisa families of computers until the other models were discontinued in
            the
            1990s. </p>
